First 12 hours of LD are over and.. Transient team is on the road to deliver
two games this time! While this may sound reckless, we are doing ok
(if not great) so far.

Brief info:

1. Space colony card game, with spirulence leading development. Cheshir is
currently doing the art with others possibly joining later. Progress so far:
some card manipulation works, development plan is ready, some WIP art.

2. Visual novel about dark future with weird interpretation of theme, with
caryoscelus leading development (= writing most or all of it). This will feature
lonely2012's art and maybe someone else will join later. Progress so far: some
text, some WIP art, most of planning is done.
